          <h2>Book 1: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h2>
          <p>
            Harry Potter is the most miserable, lonely boy you can imagine. He’s
            shunned by his relatives, the Dursley’s, that have raised him since
            he was an infant. He’s forced to live in the cupboard under the
            stairs, forced to wear his cousin Dudley’s hand-me-down clothes, and
            forced to go to his neighbour’s house when the rest of the family is
            doing something fun. Yes, he’s just about as miserable as you can
            get.
          </p>

          <p>
            Harry’s world gets turned upside down on his 11th birthday, however.
            A giant, Hagrid, informs Harry that he’s really a wizard, and will
            soon be attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry
            also learns that, in the wizarding world, he’s a hero. When he was
            an infant, the evil Lord Voldemort killed his parents and then tried
            to kill Harry too. What’s so amazing to everyone is that Harry
            survived, and allegedly destroyed Voldemort in the process.
          </p>

          <p>
            When Harry hears all this, he doesn’t know what to think. However,
            everything Hagrid tells him turns out to be true, and with a joyful
            heart Harry starts wizarding school in September. He quickly becomes
            best friends with a boy named Ron Weasley, and before they even make
            it to Christmas, they break tons of school rules when they attack a
            troll and prevent it from killing fellow student Hermione Granger.
            After the troll incident, the three become inseparable, and Harry is
            amazed to have found such great friends. He is constantly busy
            trying to stay on top of the mounds of homework, as well as
            participating in weekly Quidditch practices. Quidditch is a popular
            sport among wizards and Harry is the youngest Quidditch player in
            over a century. It's also a game Harry loves more than anything else
            at school.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the year progresses, the three friends set out to solve the
            mystery of the gigantic three-headed dog that is guarding something
            in a deserted corridor in the school. They figure out that a very
            valuable object, the Sorcerer’s Stone, is being hidden in the
            school, although they don’t know why. When one of the professors
            starts acting as if he’s trying to steal it, they quickly take
            action to circumvent the theft.
          </p>

          <p>
            Things come to a head when they sneak past the vicious, three-headed
            dog and go down into the bowels of the school, determined to save
            the stone. Ron and Hermione help Harry get through the challenges
            set forth to stop the thief, but Harry must go on alone to battle
            the professor. When he finally gets to the last room, however, he’s
            astonished to find someone else entirely.
          </p>

          <p>
            Harry is forced to do battle with the wizard that tried to kill him
            so many years before, Lord Voldemort. He’s able to save the
            Sorcerer’s Stone, although he’s almost killed in process. The school
            headmaster, Dumbledore, arrives just in time to save Harry.
          </p>

          <p>
            The school year ends spectacularly. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are
            honored for their service to the school, and Harry leaves to go back
            to the Dursley’s for the summer feeling as if he’s finally found a
            place where he really belongs.

          <h2>Book 2: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2>
          <p>
            It’s been another long summer at the Dursley’s for Harry Potter. He
            can’t wait to get back to Hogwarts and is counting down the days
            until he can return. He’s surprised when, on his birthday, a strange
            elfish creature named Dobby shows up with dire warnings for Harry:
            He must not return to Hogwarts!
          </p>

          <p>
            When Harry refuses to stay home from school, Dobby lands him in
            heaps of trouble with the Dursley’s, who lock Harry up in his room
            and refuse to let him out. Before Harry can sink too far into
            despair, however, Ron Weasley and his two brothers, twins Fred and
            George, come to his rescue in a flying car and spirit him back to
            their house, where Harry is thrilled to spend the remainder of the
            summer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus starts an eventful second year for Harry Potter. Between having
            to cope with more homework than ever, a Defense Against the Dark
            Arts professor who is vain and convinced Harry is too, and a
            mysterious voice he keeps hearing in the walls, Harry’s days are
            nothing if not interesting.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the school year progresses, however, the mysterious voice Harry
            keeps hearing is getting more and more menacing, and soon vicious
            attacks start happening to the students of Hogwarts. When Harry
            discovers, quite by accident, that he is a Parslemouth and can speak
            to snakes, he’s quickly singled out as Slytherin’s heir, the person
            who, according to legend, will open the mysterious “Chamber of
            Secrets” and release the monster within.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course Harry has no idea who is attacking the students, but he
            quickly resolves to find out who is responsible. He, Ron, and
            Hermione come up with an elaborate plan to disguise themselves as
            Slytherin students so they can question Draco Malfoy, whom they
            believe is the one setting the monster loose in the school. The plan
            goes perfectly, but they’re disappointed when they find out from
            Draco that he is not the one they’re looking for.
          </p>

          <p>
            The quest gets personal when Hermione is attacked and petrified by
            the monster. Ron and Harry are devastated, and are left on their own
            to uncover the true identity of the person responsible. Events come
            to a head when Ron’s sister, Ginny, is kidnapped and taken down into
            the Chamber of Secrets, and Ron and Harry discover an important clue
            that Hermione left for them. They quickly head down into the Chamber
            of Secrets to rescue Ginny.
          </p>

          <p>
            Harry and Ron get separated once they’re down there and Harry is
            left to pursue the monster on his own. He quickly finds Ginny, and
            thanks to some mysterious help from Dumbledore and his pet phoenix,
            Fawkes, Harry is able to destroy Slytherin’s heir, who turns out to
            be a younger version of Lord Voldemort. Voldemort had possessed
            Ginny through an enchanted diary and was using her to set the
            monster loose on the students.
          </p>

          <p>
            Harry and Ron are both hailed as heroes when they make it back out
            with Ginny, and Harry can’t imagine a finer end to such an eventful
            year when Hermione and the rest of the victims are healed and they
            win Gryffindor loads of House points.

          <h2>Book 3: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2>
          <p>
            Harry starts off his third year at Hogwarts rather eventfully when
            he inadvertently blows up his Aunt Marge, goes on the run, and is
            then personally absolved by the Minister of Magic himself. He then
            learns that mass murderer, Sirius Black, is intent on killing him,
            and Mr. Weasley makes him promise a strange thing, that no matter
            what he hears he won’t go looking for Black. Confused, Harry agrees.
          </p>

          <p>
            As he heads back to school armed with this knowledge, he learns that
            dementors, evil, soul-sucking creatures, have been stationed around
            Hogwarts to protect the students from Black. The dementors affect
            Harry much more than the other students because of his terrible
            past, and he quickly resolves to learn to defend himself when he
            begins collapsing every time they come near. He finds a willing
            teacher in Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts
            professor, who begins teaching Harry the Patronus Charm, which is
            the only spell that will work against the foul creatures.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the school year progresses, the third year students are buried
            under piles of homework. Hermione is already stressed out due to her
            enormous course load, and none of them can figure out how she’s
            getting to all her classes. It doesn’t help that Hermione’s cat,
            Crookshanks, repeatedly tries to eat Ron’s rat, Scabbers, causing
            the two friends to argue ceaselessly about the animals. They stop
            speaking entirely when it’s discovered that Crookshanks seems to
            have eaten Scabbers and Ron is devastated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Harry has a few close calls with Black when he breaks into the
            castle, but Black is not apprehended. Things come to a climax as the
            school year ends when a number of events occur. First, Ron’s rat,
            Scabbers, turns out to still be alive and is really a wizard in
            disguise. This wizard, Peter Pettigrew, has chosen to hide himself
            in this way so that he can spy on Harry and his friends on behalf of
            Lord Voldemort. Harry learns that it was Peter, and not Sirius
            Black, that betrayed his parents to Voldemort. Just when Harry is
            sure Peter is finally going to be punished for his crimes, he
            escapes into the night.

          <h2>Book 4: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2>
          <p>
            Harry can’t believe it. The Weasley’s have invited him to the
            Quidditch World Cup, which means he’ll get to leave the Dursley’s
            house early and go see a game that anyone would kill to see. The
            game is intense, but not just because of the stellar players and
            non-stop action. Voldemort’s servants, the Death Eaters, make an
            appearance and the wizarding world is shocked when Voldemort’s sign
            appears in the sky after the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            When Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally make it back to Hogwarts a few
            weeks later, they’re shocked to find that the school is the host of
            the Triwizard Tournament this year. That's a competition between the
            three wizarding schools of Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons.
            The goblet of fire choses one champion for each school. There, they
            also learn, that there is an new teacher for the subject Defence
            Against the Dark Arts. It´s Mad-Eye-Moody, an ex-auror. When the
            students from the other schools arrive in October, the students
            begin putting their name in the Goblet of Fire in order to be chosen
            at Halloween as their school's champion. The champion of Hogwarts is
            Cedric Diggory, the champion of Durmstrang is Victor Krum, a famous
            Quidditch-player and the champion of Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour.
            Harry is shocked beyond belief when, in spite of his inability to
            compete because of his age, he’s chosen as the fourth school
            champion.
          </p>

          <p>
            What’s even worse is that Ron doesn’t believe that Harry didn’t put
            his name in the goblet. They get into a huge fight, and Ron stops
            talking to Harry. The rest of Hogwarts is also incensed that Harry
            is "looking for more fame", and the only person who stands by
            Harry’s side is Hermione. In the tournament, the champions must
            steal a golden eye from a dragon. Harry accomplish this task and the
            hazard of the fight against the dragon convinces Ron, that Harry had
            always told the truth and he reconcile with him. As the school year
            progresses Harry is beset with troubles. Snooping journalist, Rita
            Skeeter, continues to publish gossipy articles about Harry that
            alienate him from the rest of the school, he’s turned down by his
            crush, Cho Chang, when he asks her to the Yule Ball, and in the days
            leading up to the second task of the tournament, which involves
            retrieving something important from the bottom of a lake filled with
            mer-people, he almost doesn’t find a way to accomplish what he’s got
            to do. Saved at the last minute, however, Harry again gets almost
            full marks and is tied for first place.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the final task of the tournament, the champions are in a knot
            garden, they need to look for the Winner´s Cup. The plants which
            build the maze caught Cedric,the other champion of Hogwarts, but
            Harry helps him. Harry and Cedric decide to be jointly the winner,
            so they put their hands on the winner´s cup, but in this moment they
            are transported to a graveyard where Cedric is killed by Wormtrail.
            Harry witnessed Voldemort’s return to power, and barely makes it
            back to Hogwarts alive, clutching Cedric’s body. Back at Hogwarts,
            Professor Moody comforts him, but then Harry discovers, that he is a
            traitor, who infiltrated Hogwarts in order of Voldemort. He’s a
            Death Eater who transmuted his body with Polyjuice Potion. Harry
            warns Dumbledore and the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge about
            the occurrence wit Voldemort, but only Dumbledore believes him. He
            starts to arrange the defense for the return of the dark lord.

          <h2>Book 5: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</h2>
          <p>
            It's been another long, hot summer at the Dursleys' for Harry
            Potter. Having spent most of it in an adolescent "funk" of
            depression and bitterness over the lack of informative letters from
            his friends about Voldemort's return, he's suddenly jolted out of
            his bad mood when two Dementors show up in the town of Little
            Whinging and attack Harry and his cousin, Dudley. When Harry uses
            magic to drive them off, however, he quickly receives a succession
            of owls from the Ministry, requiring him to attend a disciplinary
            hearing. His heart sinks when he reads that the question of whether
            to expel him from Hogwarts will be decided at the hearing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Harry is exonerated at the hearing but when Harry finally manages to
            make it back to school, he finds things are different than when he
            left. Hagrid's missing, there are skeletal horses pulling the school
            carriages that only he can see, and the new Defense Against the Dark
            Arts teacher is none other than toadlike, repulsive Dolores
            Umbridge, a Ministry representative whom Harry is all too familiar
            with.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even worse is the constant mutterings of the other students. Having
            spent all summer discrediting both Harry and Dumbledore, the
            Ministry has succeeded in convincing everyone they're both crazy and
            that Voldemort's return is nothing but a figment of their
            imagination.
          </p>

          <p>
            With only Ron and Hermione standing by his side, Harry is
            hard-pressed to stay in a good mood and often lashes out at the ones
            he is closest to. His defiant behavior lands him in detention for
            weeks at a time with Professor Umbridge, who soon rises to the
            status of Hogwarts High Inquistor and revels in sacking teachers and
            keeping the entire school under the control of her stubby,
            ugly-ringed fingers.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the school year progresses Harry and Umbridge frequently lock
            horns, and she retaliates by taking away everything he cares about:
            Quidditch, letters from Sirius, and visits with Hagrid. So Harry
            fights back the only way he can, by forming a secret defense group,
            known as Dumbledore's Army, and teaching his friends how to fight
            properly. In spite of the frantic workload in preparing for their
            OWLs (tests that determine the student's future career choices), the
            tyranny of Umbridge, and Harry's unbearable crush on Ravenclaw
            seeker, Cho Chang, Harry keeps having tantalizing dreams of dark
            corridors and locked doors that are distracting at best. His scar
            prickles constantly and he soon finds he's turned into a tiny
            antenna for Voldemort's mood swings, which certainly doesn't help
            his own temper.
          </p>

          <p>
            Things take a disastrous turn when Dolores Umbridge finds out about
            Harry's secret defense group. Harry is filled with guilt when
            Dumbledore, claims credit for the group in order to protect Harry,
            and has to flee the school to escape arrest. This installment ends
            with an epic battle of good and evil, resulting in a devastating
            loss to Harry when his godfather Sirius Black is killed, and the
            full revelation that his destiny lies intertwined with none other
            than Voldemort himself. In the end, Dumbledore reveals the lost
            prophecy to Harry: either Harry will kill Lord Voldemort or
            Voldemort will kill Harry.
